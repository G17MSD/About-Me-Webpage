      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Gurman. I'm 16 years old and passionate about coding. I live in
        Bradford with my mum, dad, sister, 2 cats, and a dog. I have experience
        with various programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, HTML,
        CSS, and C++. I've completed Harvard's CS50 course, and I'm currently
        learning SQL, which I find easy and enjoyable. I have recently joined
        Calderdale College and am looking forward to the next two years to come.

      <h2>Personal Life</h2>
      <p>
        Outside of coding, I have a few hobbies that I really enjoy. Iâ€™m a big
        football fan, I support Manchester United, went to a match at Old
        Trafford vs Chelsea in December, and try to watch every match fully
        (Even if we get battered) and even met former player Henrikh Mkhitaryan
        outside the training ground. I also enjoy playing games on my PS5,
        especially FC 24 and various shooting games. I find Gaming to be a great
        way for me to unwind and have some fun either alone or with friends
        after studying or learning
